  You can use !include tag to include another YAML file.
  When including entire YAML file, you can omit jsonpath parameter
  (it is equivalent to set jsonpath '$').
  It is even valid to omit filepath keyword (see workflows section).

  If several YAML files are passed,
  they are concatenated into single array (see jobs section).

usage:
  version: !include
    filepath: ./constants.yml
    jsonpath: '$.version'
  jobs: !include
    - filepath: ./jobs1.yml
      jsonpath: '$'
    - filepath: ./jobs2.yml
  workflows: !include ./workflows.yml
