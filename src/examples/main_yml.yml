  You can use !include tag to include other YAML files.

  When including entire YAML file, you can omit jsonpath parameter.
  It is even valid to omit filepath keyword (see executors section).

  If several YAML files are passed,
  they are concatenated into single array (see jobs section).

  --------------------
  # main.yml (before other files are included)
  version: !include
    filepath: ./constants.yml
    jsonpath: '$.version'
  executors: !include ./executors.yml
  jobs:
    executor: main-executor
    steps: !include
      - filepath: ./jobs1.yml
      - filepath: ./jobs2.yml
  workflows: !include ./workflows.yml

  ---
  # constants.yml
  version: 2.1

  ---
  # executors.yml
  main-executor:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base

  ---
  # steps1.yml
  - run: echo "this is first step of steps1.yml"
  - run: echo "this is second step of steps1.yml"

  ---
  # steps2.yml
  - run: echo "this is only step of steps2.yml"

  --------------------

  After other YAML files are included, main.yml looks like this.


usage:
  version: 2.1
  executors:
    main-executor:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/base
  jobs:
    main-job:
      executor: main-executor
      steps:
        - run: echo "this is first step of steps1.yml"
        - run: echo "this is second step of steps1.yml"
        - run: echo "this is only step of steps2.yml"
  workflows:
      main-workflow:
        jobs:
          - main-job
