  You can use !include tag to include other YAML files.

  When including entire YAML file, you can omit jsonpath parameter.
  It is even valid to omit filepath keyword (see executors section).

  If several YAML files are passed,
  they are merged into single array or map (see jobs and workflows section).

  --------------------
  # main.yml (before other files are included)
  version: !include
    filepath: ./constants.yml
    jsonpath: '$.version'
  executors: !include ./executors.yml
  jobs:
    main-job:
      executor: my-executor
      steps: !include
        - filepath: ./steps1.yml
        - filepath: ./steps2.yml
    sub-job:
      executor: my-executor
      steps:
        - run: echo 'this is only step of sub-job'
  workflows: !include
    - filepath: ./main-workflow.yml
    - filepath: ./sub-workflow.yml

  ---
  # constants.yml
  version: 2.1

  ---
  # executors.yml
  my-executor:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:current

  ---
  # steps1.yml
  - run: echo "this is first step of steps1.yml"
  - run: echo "this is second step of steps1.yml"

  ---
  # steps2.yml
  - run: echo "this is only step of steps2.yml"

  ---
  # main-workflow.yml
  main-workflow:
    jobs:
      - main-job

  ---
  # sub-workflow.yml
  sub-workflow:
    jobs:
      - sub-job

  --------------------

  After other YAML files are included, main.yml looks like this.


usage:
  version: 2.1
  executors:
    my-executor:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/base
  jobs:
    main-job:
      executor: my-executor
      steps:
        - run: echo "this is first step of steps1.yml"
        - run: echo "this is second step of steps1.yml"
        - run: echo "this is only step of steps2.yml"
    sub-job:
      executor: my-executor
      steps:
        - run: echo "this is only step of sub-job"
  workflows:
    main-workflow:
      jobs:
        - main-job
    sub-workflow:
      jobs:
        - sub-job
